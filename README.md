It takes in voice from the user and picks some words according to the code fed and gives output which can be in the form of text or speech.

# Expected output
Opens up facebook, tells the current time, interacts on provoking, surfs wikipedia for the information we ask and also plays the song asked for. One of the special feature is that 
alexa sends birthday wishes to anyone at anytime you ask even though you are sleeping or not available . That is you can set the number to which the message need to be sent as well as the time , Alexa automatically types and sends the message in time.
